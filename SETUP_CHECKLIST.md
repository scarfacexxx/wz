This checklist covers all major components needed to get Wizards of X up and running. Each section can be worked on independently, but some dependencies exist (e.g., infrastructure must be set up before database configuration). The checklist should be used alongside the detailed documentation provided in the .cursorrules and HOW_TO_BUILD.md files.
